# NukeGates
 EXILED plugin for SCP:SL that closes Gate A and Gate B shortly after the nuke starts.

# Notes:
- See your EXILED config for options to change what keycards are allowed to override the lockdown, and how long the gates should stay open. (Make sure you run the server at least once with the plugin so the configs generate.)
